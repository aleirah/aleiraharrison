  <h1> Phishing, Flaming, and Spamming </h1>
<p> In my opinion, theyâ€™re only somewhat similar, because either the message is sent through email or it is put on the internet rather than directly to your cell phone. With both flaming and spamming, you would know who sent the message whereas with phishing you would be under the impression that it is the person/company that they are claiming to be. Phishing would really be the odd man out, because they want to know things that could potentially dig a hole for you; which would cause a lot of problems financially. Flaming and spamming could be the same thing, simply because someone who is spamming you could also be sending rude messages. </p>
